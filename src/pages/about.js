            I was into science, now I’m into tech. I started to learn to code while finding a career path after graduating from college. I took an intro to programming course on Coursera and I was hooked. Even when working a full-time job, I’d still spare out time each week to learn more about web development. I find web development exciting and even went through an intensive period of study to immerse myself with programming.
